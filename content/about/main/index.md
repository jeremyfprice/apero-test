intro: Dr. Jeremy F. Price is a public scholar-advocate and educator invested in using his experiences and expertise to engage and build capacity and capital in educational settings for marginalized and minoritized youth and communities to build, strengthen, and sustain an inclusive and just democratic project.{{< figure src="/img/research-visualization.png" title="" >}} Jeremy works to prepare preservice and inservice educators to use technology for just, equitable, and inclusive purposes that honors learners, their identities, and their communities. Jeremy also works to provide educators in all fields with opportunities to interrogate, examine, and learn to teach through and discuss topics such as race, religion, hate, and extremism. Dr. Price investigates teaching practices grounded in reflection and social justice through multiple lenses, such as social network theory, communities of practice, and mindful and contemplative practices. In addition, he explores the ways that technology can be used to give marginalized students a voice and a platform for exploring the intersection of place, environment and community. Prior to taking the position at IUPUI, Jeremy has been involved in teacher education and technology-based curriculum design, research, and evaluation in a range of places and settings, including West Virginia, the San Francisco Bay area, metropolitan Boston, and Los Angeles. {{< fa bolt >}} Hugo {{< fa heart >}} {{< fa fab creative-commons >}}
