This chapter charts the journey of undergraduate pre-service teachers learning to recognize the uniqueness and diversity in themselves and others by developing contemplative and mindful inquiry practices. Most students in the course grew up in a predominantly rural Appalachian state where the prevailing narrative from inside and out was that the population was homogeneous and monolithic in terms of characteristics and outlook despite evidence to the contrary. Contemplative pedagogy was a central feature of this course to support pre-service teachers in recognizing their inner lives and the stories, narratives, and prejudices that may be conveyed about them as well as those they may convey about others. The course culminated in the opportunity for students to learn to suspend their assumptions and judgment and to cultivate compassion by exploring the ways that Appalachians are cast in the popular imagination and to collaboratively create a quilt that redefines this framing.
