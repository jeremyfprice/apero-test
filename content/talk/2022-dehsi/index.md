Cultivating an understanding of place, privilege, power, history, culture, and environment are essential requisites for educators at all levels and for all subject areas. Jeremy will discuss the ways in which he uses digital tools with his undergraduate teacher education students to provide an opportunity to explore what place means to them and to develop a respectful understanding of the neighborhood on which the IUPUI campus is built on through an exploration of the cultural and environmental history of this place.
